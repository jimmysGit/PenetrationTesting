# PenetrationTesting
A bunch of penetration testing stuff including documents and walkthroughs

# Report improvements
Given the lack of time and experience i had to write the report i have found a bunch of improvements that i could have made to make the report better.
#Information gathering
There was no information gathering required for this report other than a scan of the machine. Most cases will require gathering of target information from various search engines.
#cve/cwe
There are relevant CWE's such as,
Anonymous FTP is enabled:CVE 0497
Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type: CWE-434
Although i spoke about these problems in limited detail providing the relevant cve or cwe could be useful.
#structure
I was missing a few normal headings such as methodology as they were not required for the assesment at hand. This did however end up with an extended attack section
#table
I think providing a table or graph representation of the vulnerabilities found and their associated risk could provide to be 
beneficial in the executive summary as it provides a simple and easy to understand visual representation of the problems found.
