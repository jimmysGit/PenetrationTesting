# PenetrationTesting
A bunch of penetration testing stuff including documents and walkthroughs

# Report improvements
I was given 2 hours to assess the machine and write a report. I have since found fewimprovements that i could have made to make the report better. Below i have listed some improvements that i believe i could have made.

# Information gathering
There was no information gathering required for this report other than a scan of the subnet and subsequent machine. Most cases will require gathering of target information from various sources which could result in a more detailed information gathering section.

# CVE/CWE
In the given time period i was not able to find some CVE/CWE's even though i had recognised the vulnerability.
There are relevant CWE's such as,

Anonymous FTP is enabled:CVE 0497

Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type: CWE-434

Although i spoke about these problems in limited detail providing the relevant cve or cwe could be useful.
# Structure
I was missing a few normal headings such as methodology as they were not required for the assesment at hand. This did however cause me to end up with an extended attack section.I believe it would have been beneficial if i had the time to detail the methodology i used in a sub heading.
# Table
I think providing a table or graph representation of the vulnerabilities found and their associated risk could provide to be 
beneficial in the executive summary as it provides a simple and easy to understand visual representation of the problems found.
