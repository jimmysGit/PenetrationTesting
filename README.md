# PenetrationTesting
A bunch of penetration testing stuff including documents and walkthroughs

# Report improvements
Given the lack of time and experience i had to write the report i have found a bunch of improvements that i could have made to make the report better. Below i have listed some improvements that i know of.

# Information gathering
There was no information gathering required for this report other than a scan of the subnet and subsequent machine. Most cases will require gathering of target information from other various sources and may therefore be more detailed.

# Cve/Cwe
I was not able to find some CWE/CVE's in the given time and im sure i missed many more however the problems i did mention upon further investigation had relevant CWE/CVE's.
There are relevant CWE/CVE's such as,
Anonymouse FTP is enabled:CVE 0497
Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type: CWE-434
Although i spoke about these problems in limited detail providing the relevant cve or cwe could be useful.

# Structure
I was missing a few normal headings such as methodology as they were not required for the assesment at hand. This did however cause end up with an extended attack section where i probably should have used a methodology section to detail the method i was followoing.

# Table
I think providing a table or graph representation of the vulnerabilities found and their associated risk could provide to be 
beneficial in the executive summary as it provides a simple and easy to understand visual representation of the problems found.
